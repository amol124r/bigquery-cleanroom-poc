## GCP BigQuery Clean Room / Analytics Hub POC (Producer → Clean Room → Consumer)

This repo is a **runbook + reproducible POC scaffold** for validating **what a consumer can and cannot do** with data shared by a producer using:

- **BigQuery Sharing / Analytics Hub**
- **BigQuery Data Clean Rooms** (built on Analytics Hub)
- **Linked datasets**
- **Analysis rules** (clean room privacy/query restrictions)
- **Data egress controls** (copy/export/materialization restrictions)

### What this POC proves

You will stand up:

- **Producer project**: owns raw data tables.
- **Clean room project**: owns the clean room and publishes listings.
- **Consumer project**: subscribes, gets a **linked dataset**, and attempts various operations.

The end state is a documented matrix of:

- **Viewable** (what consumer can see/query)
- **Joinable** (can they join with their own tables?)
- **Materializable** (can they create derived tables / CTAS?)
- **Exportable / Copyable** (can they download/export/copy/snapshot/clone?)

### Important constraint

This environment (Cursor sandbox) **cannot log into your GCP account** or create projects on your behalf. The repo provides:

- **Console click-paths**
- **`gcloud`/`bq` commands**
- **SQL scripts**
